## R based Exploratory Data Analysis Project- What Determines Wine Quality

## Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal, rigorous statistical analyses are applied. EDA can lead to insights, which may uncover to other questions, and eventually predictive models. Data, by itself, is "ubiquitous and cheap," says Google's Chief Economist and UC Berkeley professor Hal Varian. What you do as a data analyst is take that data and turn it into insights.It also is an important “line of defense” against bad data and is an opportunity to notice that the assumptions or intuitions about a data set are violated.

Therefore in this project, I learned skills to frame and present data using R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies, and in the end, provide solid insights about what factors in the end determines wine quality and what factors doesn't actually matter.

## Skills Used
- Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
- Quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
- Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
- Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

More specificly, they are: 
EDA | Define and identify the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
R |Install RStudio and packages; Write R scripts to inspect datasets
EXPLORE ONE VARIABLE | Quantify and visualize individual variables within a dataset ➔ Create histograms and boxplots; ransform variables; Examine and identify tradeoffs in visualizations
EXPLORE TWO VARIABLES | Properly apply relevant techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set; Create scatter plots; Calculate correlations; Investigate conditional means
EXPLORE MANY VARIABLES | Reshape data frames and use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover information
WINE QUALITY PREDICTIONS | Use predictive modeling to determine wine quality

## Software and Libraries
