## Project Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, I am interested to put my new machine learning skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. 


## Skills Used
- Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
- Validate a machine learning result using test data
- Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
- Create, select and transform features
- Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
- Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
- Communicate your machine learning algorithm results clearly

More specificly, they are :

Skills | Tasks
--- | ---
SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION |Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify text;Implement Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to generate new features independently on the fly;Implement decision trees as a launching point for more sophisticated methods like random forests and boosting
DATASETS AND QUESTIONS |Wrestle the Enron dataset into a machine-learning-ready format in preparation for detecting cases of fraud
REGRESSIONS AND OUTLIERS |Use regression algorithms to make predictions and identify and clean outliers from a dataset
UNSUPERVISED LEARNING |Use the k-means clustering algorithm for pattern-searching on unlabeled data
FEATURES, FEATURES, FEATURES |Use feature creation to take your human intuition and change raw features into data a computer can use;Use feature selection to identify the most important features of your data;Implement principal component analysis (PCA) for a more sophisticated take on feature selection;Use tools for parsing information from text-type data
VALIDATION AND EVALUATION |Implement the train-test split and cross-validation to validate and understand machine learning results;Quantify machine learning results using precision, recall, and F1 score

## Software and Libraries
