1. Map Area 
For this case study, I picked Sinagapore. First of all I live here for 2 years so I think of it immediately. Besides, even it is a tiny city country ( actually its nickname is 'little red dot') , I am overwhelmed by its complicated city planning and full-scale facilities. I am excited to check out the awaiting suprising facts hidden in this OpenStreetMap data!

2. Sample Area
For sampling, I picked NUS campus area (National University of Singapore). Since I am very familiar with it.
