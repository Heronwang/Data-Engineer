## Python Data Wrangling Project with SQL- Investigating Singapore OpenStreetMap
Data munging skills are some of the most important for career of data engineers, as data engineers always need to wrangle data before using them for any analysis. For this project, I choosed `Singapore` map from https://www.openstreetmap.org as the case of study, as I am very interested to see the unseen part of the little red doton pacific ocean that I am both familiar with and alien to, by the data mining skills I have learned. This is quite a time-consuming and exhausting project, but I learned a lot useful handy data munging techniques from it, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. Finally, I used SQL as the data schema to wrap up the data investigation part.


## Skills Used
- Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .csv, .json, .xml, and .html
- Process data from multiple files or very large files that can be cleaned programmatically.
- Store, query, and aggregate data using SQL.
More Specificly, they are:
Skills | Tasks
