## Python Data Wrangling Project with SQL- Investigating Singapore OpenStreetMap
Data munging skills are some of the most important for career of data engineers, as data engineers always need to wrangle data before using them for any analysis. For this project, I choosed `Singapore` map from https://www.openstreetmap.org as the case of study, as I am very interested to see the unseen part of the little red doton pacific ocean that I am both familiar with and alien to, by the data mining skills I have learned. This is quite a time-consuming and exhausting project, but I learned a lot useful handy data munging techniques from it, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. Finally, I used SQL as the data schema to wrap up the data investigation part.


## Skills Used
- Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .csv, .json, .xml, and .html
- Process data from multiple files or very large files that can be cleaned programmatically.
- Store, query, and aggregate data using SQL.
DATA EXTRACTION FUNDAMENTALS
➔ Properly assess the quality of a dataset
➔ Understand how to parse CSV files and XLS with XLRD ➔ Use JSON and Web APIs
DATA IN MORE COMPLEX FORMATS
➔ Understand XML design principles ➔ Parse XML & HTML
➔ Scrape websites for relevant data
DATA QUALITY
➔ Understand common sources for dirty data
➔ Measure the quality of a dataset & apply a blueprint for
cleaning
➔ Properly audit validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency,
and uniformity of a dataset
WORKING WITH MONGODB
➔ Understand how data is modeled in MongoDB ➔ Run field and projection queries
➔ Import data into MongoDB using mongoimport ➔ Utilize operators like $gt, $lt, $exists, $regex
➔ Query arrays and using $in and $all operators ➔ Change entries using $update, $set, $unset
ANALYZING DATA
➔ Identify common examples of the aggregation framework
➔ Use aggregation pipeline operators $match, $project, $unwind,
$group
SQL FOR DATA ANALYSIS
➔ Understand how data is structured in SQL
➔ Run queries to summarize data
➔ Use joins to combine information across tables ➔ Create tables and import data from csv
CASE STUDY: OPENSTREETMAP DATA
➔ Use iterative parsing for large datafiles
➔ Understand XML elements in OpenStreetMap
