## Python Data Wrangling Project with SQL- Investigating Singapore OpenStreetMap
Data munging skills are some of the most important for career of data engineer as data engineer will always need to wrangle data before we can do any analysis. In this project, you’ll use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.

You will choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Finally, you will choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete your project.

What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will be able to:

Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.
Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .csv, .json, .xml, and .html
Process data from multiple files or very large files that can be cleaned programmatically.
Learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using MongoDB or SQL.
The skills in this project are some of the most important for your career. Any data analyst will need to wrangle data before they can do any analysis. At Udacity, how would we know when students submit projects unless we made sure to report the timestamp? How would we be able to compare that to when students finish watching videos unless we built data pipelines to get all of this information in one place? Data analysts help with collecting and cleaning the data, or what is often called "data wrangling."

DATA EXTRACTION FUNDAMENTALS
➔ Properly assess the quality of a dataset
➔ Understand how to parse CSV files and XLS with XLRD ➔ Use JSON and Web APIs
DATA IN MORE COMPLEX FORMATS
➔ Understand XML design principles ➔ Parse XML & HTML
➔ Scrape websites for relevant data
DATA QUALITY
➔ Understand common sources for dirty data
➔ Measure the quality of a dataset & apply a blueprint for
cleaning
➔ Properly audit validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency,
and uniformity of a dataset
WORKING WITH MONGODB
➔ Understand how data is modeled in MongoDB ➔ Run field and projection queries
➔ Import data into MongoDB using mongoimport ➔ Utilize operators like $gt, $lt, $exists, $regex
➔ Query arrays and using $in and $all operators ➔ Change entries using $update, $set, $unset
ANALYZING DATA
➔ Identify common examples of the aggregation framework
➔ Use aggregation pipeline operators $match, $project, $unwind,
$group
SQL FOR DATA ANALYSIS
➔ Understand how data is structured in SQL
➔ Run queries to summarize data
➔ Use joins to combine information across tables ➔ Create tables and import data from csv
CASE STUDY: OPENSTREETMAP DATA
➔ Use iterative parsing for large datafiles
➔ Understand XML elements in OpenStreetMap
