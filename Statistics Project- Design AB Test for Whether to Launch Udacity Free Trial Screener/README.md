## Project Overview
A/B tests are how data analysts determine whether one change causes another. Looking at historical data can only show that two changes are correlated. Correctly setting up and interperting A/B tests is a key skill for data analysts.
For this project, I considered an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. I fleshed the experiment idea out into a fully defined design,including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run, analyzed the results, and proposed a high-level follow-on experiment.

## Skills Used
- Select metrics to evaluate a proposed change
- Characterize and validate those metrics
- Plan an appropriate duration for your experiment based on the number of samples needed and the expected risk
- Sanity check the results to make sure everything went smoothly
- Draw a conclusion based on the results and recommend whether or not to launch the change

More specificly, they are: 
Skills | Tasks
--- |---
OVERVIEW OF A/B TESTING|Identify the key concepts and considerations when designing and conducting an A/B test
POLICY AND ETHICS FOR EXPERIMENTS| Adequately protect the participants in experiments;Identify the four main ethical principles to consider when designing experiments
CHOOSING AND CHARACTERIZING METRICS|Identify techniques for brainstorming metrics;List possible alternatives when unable to directly measure a desired metric;Identify characteristics to consider when validating metrics
DESIGNING AN EXPERIMENT|Identify the proper users to be in control and experiment groups;Calculate the number of events necessary to reach significance;Define how different design decisions affect the size of your experiment
ANALYZING RESULTS | Identify the key steps for analyzing the results of an experiment; Measure multiple metrics within a single experiment; Understand why statistically significant results may disappear at launch
