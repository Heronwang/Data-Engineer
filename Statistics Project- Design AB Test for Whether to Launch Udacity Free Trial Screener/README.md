## Project Overview
A/B tests are how data analysts determine whether one change causes another. Looking at historical data can only show that two changes are correlated. Correctly setting up and interperting A/B tests is a key skill for data analysts.
For this project, you will consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. You will flesh the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment.
In this project, you’ll make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

Prepare for this project with: A/B Testing.

What will I learn?
After completing this project, you will be able to:

Select metrics to evaluate a proposed change
Characterize and validate those metrics
Plan an appropriate duration for your experiment based on the number of samples needed and the expected risk
Sanity check the results to make sure everything went smoothly
Draw a conclusion based on the results
Recommend whether or not to launch the change

OVERVIEW OF A/B TESTING
➔ Identify the key concepts and considerations when designing and conducting an A/B test
POLICY AND ETHICS FOR EXPERIMENTS
➔ Adequately protect the participants in experiments
➔ Identify the four main ethical principles to consider when
designing experiments
CHOOSING AND CHARACTERIZING METRICS
➔ Identify techniques for brainstorming metrics
➔ List possible alternatives when unable to directly measure a
desired metric
➔ Identify characteristics to consider when validating metrics
DESIGNING AN EXPERIMENT
➔ Identify the proper users to be in control and experiment groups
➔ Calculate the number of events necessary to reach significance
➔ Define how different design decisions affect the size of your
experiment
ANALYZING RESULTS
➔ Identify the key steps for analyzing the results of an experiment
➔ Measure multiple metrics within a single experiment
➔ Understand why statistically significant results may disappear
at launch
