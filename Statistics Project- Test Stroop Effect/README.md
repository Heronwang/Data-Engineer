## Statistics Project: Test Stroop Effect
In this project, I used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. With understanding of the data, I used statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

## Skills Used   

 SKllis | Tasks
 --- | ---
RESEARCH METHODS|Identify several statistical study methods and describe the positives and negatives of each
VISUALIZING DATA|Create and interpret histograms, bar charts, and frequency plots
CENTRAL TENDENCY|Compute and interpret the 3 measures of center for distributions: the mean, median, and mode
 VARIABILITY|Quantify the spread of data using the range and standard deviation; Identify outliers in data sets using the interquartile range
STANDARDIZING|Convert distributions into the standard normal distribution using the Z-score; Compute proportions using standardized distributions
NORMAL DISTRIBUTION|Use normal distributions to compute probabilities; Use the Z-table to look up the proportions of observations above, below, or in between values
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS|Apply the concepts of probability and normalization to sample data sets
ESTIMATION|Estimate population parameters from sample statistics using confidence intervals
HYPOTHESIS TESTING|Use critical values to make decisions on whether or not a treatment has changed the value of a population parameter
HYPOTHESIS TESTING|Use critical values to make decisions on whether or not a treatment has changed the value of a population parameter
T-TESTS|Test the effect of a treatment or compare the difference in means for two groups when we have small sample sizes
