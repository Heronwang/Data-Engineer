## Statistics Project: Test Stroop Effect
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. (In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.) I first learned about about the idea of the experiment and creating a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task.Then I looked at data collected from others who have performed the task and I computed the key statistics describing the results. Finally, I was able to interpret my results in terms of the hypotheses.

## Skills Used   
 Skills | Tasks
 --- | ---
RESEARCH METHODS|Identify several statistical study methods and describe the positives and negatives of each
VISUALIZING DATA|Create and interpret histograms, bar charts, and frequency plots
CENTRAL TENDENCY|Compute and interpret the 3 measures of center for distributions: the mean, median, and mode
 VARIABILITY|Quantify the spread of data using the range and standard deviation; Identify outliers in data sets using the interquartile range
STANDARDIZING|Convert distributions into the standard normal distribution using the Z-score; Compute proportions using standardized distributions
NORMAL DISTRIBUTION|Use normal distributions to compute probabilities; Use the Z-table to look up the proportions of observations above, below, or in between values
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS|Apply the concepts of probability and normalization to sample data sets
ESTIMATION|Estimate population parameters from sample statistics using confidence intervals
HYPOTHESIS TESTING|Use critical values to make decisions on whether or not a treatment has changed the value of a population parameter
HYPOTHESIS TESTING|Use critical values to make decisions on whether or not a treatment has changed the value of a population parameter
T-TESTS|Test the effect of a treatment or compare the difference in means for two groups when we have small sample sizes
