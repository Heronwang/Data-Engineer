## Project Overview 
In this project, I choosed the curated titanic datasets and investigated it using NumPy and pandas. I went through the entire data analysis process, starting by posin questions and finishing by sharing my findings.  
If you are interested in it, please check **`P2_Titanic_survival_Analysis.ipynb` or `html`** for detailed documentation!
